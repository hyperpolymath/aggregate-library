== Overview

The **aggregate-library (aLib)** project defines a minimal *Common Library* that represents the intersection of functionality across seven fundamentally different programming languages. Each language will have its own *Aggregate Library* = *Common Library* + language-specific *Standard Library*.

This project aims to reduce programming language territoriality while preserving the unique features that make each language valuable.

== Philosophy

=== Why a Common Library?

Programming languages often evolve in isolation, leading to:

* Fragmented ecosystems
* Unnecessary relearning of basic concepts
* Tribalism and language wars
* Difficulty in polyglot development

The Common Library provides:

* A shared foundation across diverse paradigms
* Minimal but useful universal operations
* A framework for understanding language similarities and differences
* A basis for cross-language tooling and interoperability

=== Design Principles

. *Minimal*: Include only operations that exist across ALL languages
. *Universal*: Operations must work across radically different paradigms
. *Testable*: Each operation has concrete, executable test cases
. *Language-agnostic*: Specifications avoid language-specific details
. *Pragmatic*: Focus on commonly needed operations

== The Seven Languages

The Common Library is defined as the intersection of these seven diverse languages:

. *WokeLang* - Consent-driven, emotional computing
. *Duet/Ensemble* - AI-first, session types, effect systems
. *Eclexia* - Sustainability-focused, energy budgets
. *Oblíbený* - Security-first, provable termination
. *RT-Lang* - Real-time systems, dependent types, safety certification
. *Phronesis* - Ethical reasoning, values-based programming
. *Julia the Viper* - Reversible computing, totality

These languages were chosen specifically because they are *radically different* in philosophy, syntax, and features - providing a rigorous stress test for what truly universal operations look like.

== Common Library Operations

The Common Library includes *20 core operations* across 6 categories:

=== Arithmetic (5 operations)

* `add` - Addition
* `subtract` - Subtraction
* `multiply` - Multiplication
* `divide` - Division
* `modulo` - Remainder

=== Comparison (6 operations)

* `less_than` - Strictly less than
* `greater_than` - Strictly greater than
* `equal` - Equality
* `not_equal` - Inequality
* `less_equal` - Less than or equal
* `greater_equal` - Greater than or equal

=== Logical (3 operations)

* `and` - Logical conjunction
* `or` - Logical disjunction
* `not` - Logical negation

=== String (3 operations)

* `concat` - String concatenation
* `length` - String length
* `substring` - Extract substring

=== Collection (4 operations)

* `map` - Transform each element
* `filter` - Select elements by predicate
* `fold` - Reduce to single value (also known as reduce)
* `contains` - Check element membership

=== Conditional (1 operation)

* `if_then_else` - Conditional branching

== What's NOT in the Common Library

The following are explicitly *excluded* from the Common Library because they vary across languages:

* Error handling mechanisms
* Concurrency primitives
* Memory management strategies
* Type system specifics beyond basic categories
* I/O operations
* Domain-specific features (consent, energy, security, ethics, etc.)
* Language-specific optimizations

These belong in each language's *Standard Library*.

== Specification Format

Each operation is specified with three components:

=== 1. Interface Signature

Abstract signature independent of language syntax:

[source]
----
operation_name: InputType1, InputType2 -> OutputType
----

=== 2. Behavioral Semantics

* Purpose and description
* Parameter definitions
* Return value specification
* Mathematical properties
* Edge cases

=== 3. Executable Test Cases

Concrete examples in YAML format:

[source,yaml]
----
test_cases:
  - input: [arg1, arg2]
    output: expected_result
    description: "What this tests"
----

See link:SPEC_FORMAT.md[] for complete details.
