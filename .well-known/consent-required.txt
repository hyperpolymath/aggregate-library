# Consent Required - HTTP 430 Protocol
# aggregate-library (aLib) - Common Library Specification

# This file documents our consent-first approach and HTTP 430 protocol support.
# HTTP 430 (Consent Required) is a proposed status code for consent-aware systems.

## Consent Philosophy

This project respects user consent and autonomy:

1. **Documentation Access**: No consent required (public specifications)
2. **Contribution**: Implicit consent via DCO signature
3. **Data Collection**: None (we collect no user data)
4. **Cookies**: None used in project infrastructure
5. **Tracking**: No analytics or tracking scripts
6. **AI Training**: See .well-known/ai.txt for policies

## HTTP 430 Support

If this project were to implement a web service, it would:

- Return HTTP 430 when consent is required but not provided
- Provide clear consent mechanisms
- Allow easy consent withdrawal
- Never assume consent
- Document all consent requirements
