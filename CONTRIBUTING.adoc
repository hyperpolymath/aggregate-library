Thank you for your interest in contributing to the aggregate-library (aLib) project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this cross-language Common Library specification.

== Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct (see link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[]). By participating, you agree to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* Git for version control
* Text editor or IDE
* Familiarity with at least one of the seven target languages
* Understanding of specification writing (helpful but not required)

=== Fork and Clone

[source,bash]
----
# Fork on GitHub/GitLab, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/aggregate-library.git
cd aggregate-library

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/aggregate-library.git

== Contribution Types

=== Specification Improvements

* Clarify ambiguous wording
* Add missing edge cases
* Improve behavioral semantics
* Enhance property descriptions

=== Test Case Additions

* Add more comprehensive test cases
* Cover additional edge cases
* Add test cases for different type combinations
* Improve test descriptions

=== Documentation

* Improve README or SPEC_FORMAT
* Fix typos and grammar
* Add examples and usage guides
* Translate documentation

=== New Operations (Rare)

* Propose new operations for Common Library
* Must exist across ALL seven languages
* Requires community discussion first
* High bar for acceptance

== Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

This project follows the TPCF model with three contribution perimeters:

=== Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox (Current)

* **Access**: Open to all contributors
* **Scope**: Documentation, test cases, specification clarifications
* **Review**: Standard pull request review
* **Timeline**: 3-7 days for most contributions

==== Requirements

* Read and follow this CONTRIBUTING guide
* Sign Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
* Pass automated validation checks
* Receive maintainer approval

=== Perimeter 2: Trusted Contributors (Future)

* **Access**: Invitation-only after sustained contributions
* **Scope**: Core specification changes, new operations
* **Requirements**:
** 6+ months of quality contributions
** Deep understanding of specification methodology
** Maintainer nomination

=== Perimeter 1: Maintainer Core

* **Access**: Maintainers only
* **Scope**: Governance decisions, release management, security
* **Process**: See link:GOVERNANCE.adoc[]

== Development Process

=== 1. Create an Issue First

Before starting work, create an issue describing:

* What you want to change
* Why it's needed
* Proposed approach

This allows for discussion before you invest time.

=== 2. Create a Branch

[source,bash]
----
# Update your fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
----

Branch prefixes:

* `feat/` - New features or operations
* `fix/` - Bug fixes or corrections
* `docs/` - Documentation changes
* `test/` - Test case additions
* `refactor/` - Restructuring without behavior changes

=== 3. Make Changes

Follow the Specification Guidelines below.

=== 4. Add SPDX Headers

All new specification files must include SPDX headers:

[source,markdown]
----
<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT OR Palimpsest-0.8 -->
<!-- SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2025 Hyperpolymath -->
----

=== 5. Test Your Changes

[source,bash]
----
# Validate specifications
just validate

# Run all tests
just test

# Check documentation
just docs

# Full compliance check
just check
----

=== 6. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

[source]
----
type(scope): subject

body

footer
----

**Types:**

* `feat`: New features
* `fix`: Bug fixes
* `docs`: Documentation changes
* `test`: Test additions
* `refactor`: Code restructuring
* `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**

[source]
----
feat(arithmetic): add edge case for add operation

Added test case for very large number addition to clarify
overflow behavior expectations.

Closes #123
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
----

=== 7. Sign Your Commits (DCO)

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO):

[source,bash]
----
git commit -s -m "feat: your commit message"
----

Or add to commit message:

[source]
----
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
----

=== 8. Push and Create Pull Request

[source,bash]
----
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
----

Then create a pull request on GitHub/GitLab.

== Specification Guidelines

=== Writing Specifications

Follow the format defined in link:SPEC_FORMAT.md[]:

. **Interface Signature**
** Use abstract, language-agnostic syntax
** Specify input and output types clearly

. **Behavioral Semantics**
** Write clear, unambiguous descriptions
** Include mathematical properties where applicable
** Document all edge cases
** Mark implementation-defined behaviors

. **Executable Test Cases**
** Use YAML format
** Include diverse inputs
** Cover edge cases
** Write descriptive test descriptions

=== Quality Standards

* **Clarity**: Specifications must be understandable by implementers
* **Completeness**: Cover all important behaviors and edge cases
* **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology across specifications
* **Testability**: Provide concrete, executable test cases
* **Language-Agnostic**: Avoid language-specific assumptions

=== What to Avoid

* ❌ Language-specific syntax or terminology
* ❌ Implementation details (memory management, performance)
* ❌ Operations that don't exist in all seven languages
* ❌ Ambiguous or vague descriptions
* ❌ Untestable requirements

== Pull Request Process

=== Before Submitting

* [ ] Follow specification guidelines
* [ ] Write clear commit messages
* [ ] Sign commits (DCO)
