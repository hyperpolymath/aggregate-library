# Funding Information
# aggregate-library (aLib) - Common Library Specification

# This file enables the "Sponsor" button in GitHub/GitLab repositories
# and provides transparent funding information for the project.

# Currently, the project is in early stages and not yet seeking funding.
# This file serves as a placeholder for future funding channels.

# When the project is ready to accept funding, we will enable:
# - OpenCollective for transparent, community-governed funding
# - Liberapay for recurring donations
# - GitHub Sponsors for per-maintainer support
# - Custom funding URLs for institutional sponsors

# Principles:
# 1. Transparency: All income and expenses will be public
# 2. Community Benefit: Funds serve project and contributors
# 3. Sustainability: Long-term financial health prioritized
# 4. Fair Compensation: Contributors compensated when possible

# Future Funding Channels (not yet active):
# open_collective: aggregate-library
# liberapay: aggregate-library
# github: [Hyperpolymath]

# Solidarity Economics:
# We believe in solidarity economics and mutual aid. When funding becomes
# available, it will support:
# - Maintainer stipends
# - Contributor bounties
# - Conference travel
# - Infrastructure costs
# - Community initiatives

# Contact:
# For institutional sponsorship inquiries or questions about funding,
# please open an issue with the 'funding' label or contact maintainers
# via the channels listed in MAINTAINERS.md
