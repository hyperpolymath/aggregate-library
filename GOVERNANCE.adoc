== Overview

The aggregate-library (aLib) project follows a transparent, community-centered governance model designed to ensure long-term sustainability, fair decision-making, and inclusive participation.

== Governance Principles

=== Core Values

. *Transparency*: All decisions made publicly with documented rationale
. *Inclusivity*: Multiple pathways for community participation
. *Meritocracy*: Contributions and expertise guide influence
. *Emotional Safety*: Well-being prioritized over velocity
. *Reversibility*: Decisions can be revisited and reversed if needed
. *Accountability*: Clear responsibility and mutual accountability (MAA)

=== Decision-Making Philosophy

We follow these principles:

* *Consensus-seeking*: Prefer agreement over voting when possible
* *Subsidiarity*: Decisions at the appropriate level (don't escalate unnecessarily)
* *Proportionality*: Decision rigor matches impact (typo fix ≠ new operation)
* *Timeliness*: Decisions made in reasonable timeframes
* *Documentation*: All decisions recorded with context

== Organizational Structure

=== Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

The project uses TPCF to balance openness with quality:

* Maintainer nomination

*Scope*:

* Core specification changes
* New operation proposals

*Decision Process*: Majority approval + maintainer veto

==== Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox
